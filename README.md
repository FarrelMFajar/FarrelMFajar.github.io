### **Key Metrics**  
- **6,523** unique active players  
- **42.4%** of players logged in but didnâ€™t play a level (critical retention issue)  
- **68.45%** level completion rate (strong core gameplay)  
- **iOS users dominated 68%** of the playerbase  

---

### **Insights**  
#### 1. **Player Retention & Engagement**  
- **42.4% of players logged in without playing a level**, indicating weak engagement hooks.  
- **Late-night logins (11 PMâ€“2 AM)** drove the highest activity, suggesting players prioritize daily rewards over gameplay.  

#### 2. **Difficulty & Monetization**  
- **Players struggled most with "BadLose" levels** (low win rate despite high retries).  
- **2,000+ players took >2 minutes to clear levels** (opportunity for monetizing "skip" buttons via ads/in-app purchases).  

#### 3. **Technical Barriers**  
- **iOS 14 users dominated (61.9%)**, but adoption of newer versions (iOS 15) was minimal.  
- **52% of players used outdated app versions**, risking compatibility issues.  

---

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Boost Engagement**:  
   - Offer **daily rewards for completing at least one level** (not just logging in).  
   - Implement **A/B testing** on limited-time login incentives.  

2. **Monetize Frustration Points**:  
   - Introduce **ad-supported skips** for levels with >2-minute clear times.  
   - Offer **power-up bundles** for "BadLose" levels (targeted at struggling players).  

3. **Technical Optimization**:  
   - **Phase out support for iOS 13/Android 9** (only 3.4% of users).  
   - Incentivize app updates with **exclusive in-game rewards** for version 1.11+ users.
